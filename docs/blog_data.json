risk of escalation persists if negotiations stall.</li>\n  <li><strong>India–Israel</strong> defence and trade cooperation announced—potential to augment <strong>Israel</strong> operational capacity in ongoing conflict dynamics.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Active Threats</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Gaza Strip</strong> — Immediate, high-impact threat: ongoing hostilities, NGO expulsions, and media access denial create acute humanitarian and information-security risks.</li>\n  <li><strong>West Bank</strong> — Elevated political-territorial threat: international impunity cited by <strong>Amnesty</strong> increases likelihood of accelerated annexation measures and localized violence.</li>\n  <li><strong>Afghanistan–Pakistan border</strong> — Active kinetic threat: reported capture of border outposts indicates potential for escalation and cross-border retaliation.</li>\n  <li><strong>US–Iran</strong> diplomatic fragility — Strategic risk: indirect talks signal possible de-escalation, but absence of concrete deliverables preserves possibility of rapid deterioration.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Recent Operational Developments</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Israeli actions in Gaza</strong>: Government moved to ban 37 NGOs; 17 aid groups petitioned the <strong>Israeli Supreme Court</strong> — immediate operational impact on aid pipelines.</li>\n  <li><strong>Journalist access</strong>: <strong>Foreign Press Association</strong> demands end to Gaza entry ban; coverage and independent verification constrained.</li>\n  <li><strong>Field-level abuses</strong>: Report of a Gaza mother identifying a missing son listed in an Israeli soldier post — potential for reputational and legal consequences if verified.</li>\n  <li><strong>Afghanistan offensive</strong>: Afghan military source reports capture of 13 border outposts; <strong>Pakistan</strong> denies losses — information contestation ongoing.</li>\n  <li><strong>US domestic and diplomatic items</strong>: Columbia University reports <strong>ICE</strong> misrepresentation to detain a student; US government seeks Supreme Court permission to deport Syrian migrants — domestic policy actions with potential diplomatic/legal fallout.</li>\n  <li><strong>US–Iran negotiations</strong>: Mediators report 'significant progress' in Geneva/Vienna technical talks; workstreams to continue.</li>\n  <li><strong>India–Israel engagement</strong>: Bilateral pledges on trade and defence during PM <strong>Modi</strong>'s visit; domestic criticism in India tied to Gaza conflict context.</li>\n  <li><strong>UK–Israel tech link</strong>: Reporting indicates UK acquisition of Israeli surveillance tools previously tested on Palestinians — potential human rights and export-control implications.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Assessment</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Highest immediate risk</strong> remains <strong>Gaza</strong> due to combined kinetic operations, humanitarian degradation, and restrictions on NGOs and media.</li>\n  <li><strong>Border instability</strong> between <strong>Afghanistan</strong> and <strong>Pakistan</strong> represents a secondary kinetic flashpoint with potential to draw regional actors into broader confrontation.</li>\n  <li><strong>Diplomatic mitigation</strong> via US–Iran talks reduces short-term strategic risk but is fragile; failure could rapidly elevate threat to wider regional security.</li>\n  <li><strong>Force-enhancement</strong> via bilateral defence cooperation (notably <strong>India–Israel</strong>) may shift operational balances and lengthen conflict duration if materiel transfers occur.</li>\n  <li><strong>Information environment</strong> is degraded: NGO bans, journalist exclusion, and contested narratives increase the risk of unverified reporting and escalation based on misinformation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Recommended Actions</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Prioritise open-source monitoring of <strong>Gaza</strong> humanitarian routes, NGO legal challenges, and journalist access incidents for verification and early-warning.</li>\n  <li>Task collection assets to track ground movements and claims on the <strong>Afghanistan–Pakistan</strong> border; corroborate via independent geolocated imagery where possible.</li>\n  <li>Monitor <strong>US–Iran</strong> technical workstreams in <strong>Vienna</strong>/<strong>Geneva</strong> for signs of breakdown; flag shifts in military posture by regional actors.</li>\n  <li>Assess defence cooperation deliverables from <strong>India–Israel</strong> announcements for capability timelines that could affect operational planning in the Levant.</li>\n  <li>Document and archive alleged rights abuses and contested online posts (e.g., claimed sale listings) to support future legal and accountability processes.</li>\n</ul>"
