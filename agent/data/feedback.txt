Architect Suggestion: "Implement a new crawler named crawler_nytimes_rss.py. This crawler should pull data from the New York Times RSS feed available at https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml. The crawler should be designed to parse the XML data in the feed, extracting key information such as article title, description, publication date, and link. Be sure to handle any potential XML parsing errors and include functionality to avoid duplicate collection of articles already crawled. Once data is extracted, format it for upload to our database, ensuring consistency with our current data structure. Also, remember to schedule the crawler to run at regular intervals for up-to-date data collection."
Architect Suggestion: "Add a new crawler for the Al Jazeera's RSS feed to diversify the geographical coverage of news sources and provide a broader perspective on global events. 

Instruction:

1. Create a new Python script named 'crawler_aljazeera_rss.py'.
2. Import required modules: requests and Beautiful Soup for handling and parsing HTTP requests.
    - Use `import requests` and `from bs4 import BeautifulSoup`.
3. Define the URL of Al Jazeera's RSS feed. For example, English news can be found at 'https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml'.
    - Save it in a variable `url = 'https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml'`.
4. Use the `requests.get(url)` function to send an HTTP request to the URL and save the response in a variable, say `response`.
5. Parse the returned XML content using Beautiful Soup. For example, `soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, features='xml')`.
6. Iterate over every news item using a for loop and extract necessary details like title, link, published date, and description. These can be found under tags `<title>`, `<link>`, `<pubDate>` and `<description>` respectively.
7. Save the extracted data in your preferred format or database for further analysis and usage.
8. Remember to handle exceptions and errors appropriately and log them for debugging purposes.
9. Test the script regularly to ensure it is working as expected and maintaining the data integrity."
