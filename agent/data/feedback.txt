Architect Suggestion: "Consider integrating the CNN RSS feed into our system. Create a new crawler script, name it as crawler_cnn_rss.py. The RSS feed URL for CNN is 'http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss'. Use the Python requests library to get the RSS feed and parse it using the BeautifulSoup library. Ensure the script follows the same structure and conventions as our current crawlers, including error handling and logging. After implementation, carry out tests to ensure the new crawler is functioning correctly and delivering expected results."
