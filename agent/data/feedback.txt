Architect Suggestion: "Implement a new crawler named crawler_nytimes_rss.py. This crawler should pull data from the New York Times RSS feed available at https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml. The crawler should be designed to parse the XML data in the feed, extracting key information such as article title, description, publication date, and link. Be sure to handle any potential XML parsing errors and include functionality to avoid duplicate collection of articles already crawled. Once data is extracted, format it for upload to our database, ensuring consistency with our current data structure. Also, remember to schedule the crawler to run at regular intervals for up-to-date data collection."
